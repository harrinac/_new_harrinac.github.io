<p>This project showcases a time series visualization and sales volume prediction workflow.
The challenge is to predict  6 months sales figure using time series analysis of historical sales data. 
The data used is a real-world anonymised dataset from e-commerce retailers.</p> 

<p>Techniques are shown for visualizing time series data, for decomposing into trend and seasonality components and for testing 
for non-stationarity. Methods are presented for transforming a non-stationary series into a stationary series for analysis.
This notebook provides a comparison of time-series sales forecasting methods of increasing complexity from simple moving averages to
SARIMAX forecasting methods. </p> 
<p> The quality of the forecasts is measured using the RMSE of 6 months forecasted sales data with actual/real sales values. </p>
