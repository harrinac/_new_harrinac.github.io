<p> This project showcases a risk analysis on loan payment status for the real world data from the 
Lending Club peer-to-peer lending platform. Lending Club make their data publically available. </p>

<p>This repository contains two notebooks that examine this data and analyse loan default prediction. 
This is a classification task with the aim of predicting which loans will default.
The first notebook showcases some data exploration, viualization and feature engineering.
The second notebook assess the performance of a set of standard classification algorithms against this dataset. 
Three classification algorithms were fitted against a datast of c. 80,000 loans. 
For risk-adverse investors/lenders the classification probability threshold was adjusted to reduce the numbers of False Negatives.</p>

<p> A detailed exploration of the results is provided including a demonstration of how to change the loan 
default probability thresholds for risk-adverse investors. </p>
