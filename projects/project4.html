<p> 
This project uses an anonymised excerpt of a retailer dataset to showcase a 
customer segmentation analysis using K-Means clustering. The goal is to segment customers by both 
aggregate sales patterns and specific items purchased and to provide more tailored services 
and improve marketing to customers based on segments.</p>


<p>Notebook 1 shows feature engineering through rolling up transaction-level data.
A second notebook shows dimensionality reduction using  Principle Component Analysis and finally 
a K-Means clustering analysis of the engineered dataset features. </p>

<p>
Rand Index scores are used to compare the similarity of clusters engineered against different feature sets.
This is an unsupervised learning task and subjective client-led asessment of cluster model usefulness is necessary.
