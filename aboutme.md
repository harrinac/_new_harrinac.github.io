title: About Me 
subtitle: 
---


I am an experienced technology professional 
and am committed to the success of the people and organizations I have worked with.

My background is multi-disciplinary, having had success in both industry and academia and I have lived
and worked in many different countries. This has shaped me into a flexible, adaptable person who values
diversity and views new challenges as opportunities to learn and improve. A maxim that I try to live by
is from Henry Ford: _Whether you think you can, or think that you can’t, you’re right._

I have over 18 years’ experience of building, researching and advising on technical solutions and
strategy for clients across private and public-sector industries. I have advised 
large organizations  and governments on areas including: digital strategy, Business
Intelligence and AI programs, information management and enterprise architecture. I have experience of working with
institutions in the US, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia. 

My background as a Computer Science academic also equips me to see the transformative
capabilities of technologies associated with Machine Learning, AI and Internet of Things. My PhD
research work was in the field of probabilistic planning, learning and optimization algorithms and I
believe that these technologies can drive enormous business value and improve the lives of consumers
and citizens. I am convinced of the revolutionary impact that ML/AI will have on businesses over the
next 10 years.

I work as a freelance ML/Data Science consultant and am interested to hear from people and 
orgaizations about potential cooperation. I am also very interested in any comments on any of the projects show-cased here.
